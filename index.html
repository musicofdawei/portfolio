      <b>SCAD summer program, first digital animation</b><br/>
      I never had access to a drawing tablet before, and had held off on buying one despite 
      how much digital art interested me because I was worried about how the feel would disrupt 
      my usual “flow” when drawing. I had attempted digital art before with a mousepad, so that 
      was my only experience to go off of. I found digital art with a tablet to be much more 
      gratifying than what I originally envisioned, and I also learned a lot about animation for 
      having essentially no experience with it in this medium. This is the end product of 12 hours 
      of work. Made on toon boom.

      <b>Pixel animation, stick figure with magic orb</b><br/>
      This is me beginning to teach myself sprite animation and gdot independently for a mod I want to 
      make. This stickmen was my first real jump into trying animation and honestly it was pretty fun 
      seeing what I could do. It's been a bit since I’ve started and I’ve been seeing some clear improvement 
      from my beginning animations. Made on aesprite

      <b>Flipbook animation</b><br/>
      Did this for a weeklong art class project. I chose to try and make a flipbook animation, needless to say, 
      it really got me to appreciate hand drawn animation a lot more than i originally did. I used paper too 
      thick to make it an actual flipbook, so this little montage will have to do. For my first attempt at something 
      like this I'm genuinely proud of how it turned out, it looked more fluid than I could ever imagine.

      <b>3-D modeling college summer program</b><br/>
      I learned this as part of a college summer program, and got access to use maya to create my week long project, 
      the industry leading software. I chose to learn this to have more experience with what digital artwork is like 
      since my experience in 3-D is minimal. While there was some initial difficulty with the UI, 3-d modeling ended 
      up being nice to learn. I was surprised on how much I accomplished in such a short amount of time.

      <b>Unreal VR Game</b><br/>
      Created this piece at the UNCA summer program. The main idea of the project was learning Unreal engine 
      5’s basic tools, but I chose to go beyond and try to add some of my own code.

      <b>Gameboy game NC State summer pre-college program</b><br/>
      Worked at a pace to a complete product within a week, simulating a similar pace of an actual game 
      studio though products are of much smaller scale. Emphasized group work, efficiency, and iterating 
      on ideas, which was the focus of the whole first day. The project was open ended and everyone had 
      to independently put in the effort. The final game was a top down rpg that was modeled like an old 
      gameboy game, it had a fully functioning timer system, win/lose screen, multiple endings, and its 
      own music! <a href="https://musicofdeawea.itch.io/sneaky-theif">PLAY THE GAME</a> with J and arrow keys.
